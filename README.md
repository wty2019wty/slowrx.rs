# slowrx.rs

> **A pure-Rust port of [slowrx](https://github.com/windytan/slowrx)** —

> The original is excellent; this port aims to bring it to the Rust
> ecosystem with a library-first API while preserving the algorithmic
> work that made slowrx great.

## Status

🛰️ **0.5.2 — V2.4 published.** PD120, PD180, PD240, Robot 24, Robot 36, Robot 72, Scottie 1, Scottie 2, Scottie DX, Martin 1, and Martin 2 decoding from raw audio. All four V2 mode families landed; the [V2 roadmap](https://github.com/jasonherald/slowrx.rs/issues/9) is closed. Post-V2.4 cleanup (code-review audit backlog, [epic #97](https://github.com/jasonherald/slowrx.rs/issues/97)) is in progress.

PD120, PD180, and Robot 36 are validated end-to-end against real-radio
captures: PD120/PD180 against the ARISS Dec-2017 corpus (6 of 7
fixtures decode to images visually matching the reference JPGs),
Robot 36 against the ARISS Fram2 corpus (all 12 fixtures decode to
images visually matching the reference JPGs — see
`tests/ariss_fram2_validation.md`). PD240, Robot 24, Robot 72,
Scottie 1/2/DX, and Martin 1/2 ship with synthetic round-trip coverage
only — real-radio fixtures for those modes are pending. Robot 24
inherits Robot 36's real-radio evidence by structural identity (same
decoder code path, only LineTime differs). Scottie + Martin share an
RGB-sequential decoder dispatched on `SyncPosition` (Scottie sync
sits mid-line; Martin sync at line start, the standard SSTV
convention).

## Install

```bash
# library
cargo add slowrx

# CLI tool (decodes WAV → PNG)
cargo install slowrx --features cli
```

## Quick start

```rust
use slowrx::{SstvDecoder, SstvEvent};

// Construct a decoder at the caller's audio sample rate.
let mut decoder = SstvDecoder::new(44_100).expect("valid sample rate");

// Feed audio chunks; consume events as images complete.
let audio: Vec<f32> = vec![0.0; 1024]; // mono samples in [-1.0, 1.0]
for event in decoder.process(&audio) {
    if let SstvEvent::ImageComplete { image, .. } = event {
        println!("decoded {}×{} {:?} image",
                 image.width, image.height, image.mode);
    }
}
```

CLI:

```bash
slowrx-cli --input recording.wav --output ./out
# → out/img-001-pd120.png, out/img-002-robot36.png, ...
```

When the VIS header is missing or damaged (or to decode a mode you already
know), force the mode and a decode window:

```rust
use slowrx::{DecodeWindow, SstvDecoder, SstvMode};

// Decode the image whose first line (or transmission start) is at 12.5 s.
let mut decoder = SstvDecoder::with_mode(
    44_100,
    SstvMode::Robot36,
    DecodeWindow::starting_at(12.5),
)
.expect("valid sample rate");
```

```bash
# One image starting at 12.5 s (absorbs a VIS header if one is there).
slowrx-cli --input recording.wav --output ./out --mode robot36 --start 12.5
# One image whose *data* ends at 48.5 s (length from the mode's nominal 36 s).
slowrx-cli --input recording.wav --output ./out --mode robot36 --end 48.5
slowrx-cli --list-modes
```

A forced mode **always** requires `--start` or `--end` (there is no
whole-stream scan mode). `--mode` accepts a short name (`pd120`, `robot36`) or
display name (`PD-120`, `Robot 36`), case-insensitively. The decode length is
the mode's nominal image duration (the VIS header is not counted), so only one
endpoint is needed. A VIS header beginning at a `--start` anchor is detected
and absorbed; if it is missing the anchor itself is taken as the image start
(the decoder does not search for where the image begins). The sync gate still
applies (a window with no sync pulses yields no image), and decoding stops
after that one image. See the `SstvDecoder::with_mode` docs for details.

## What it does

`slowrx.rs` decodes Slow-Scan Television images from a stream of audio
samples. Mode coverage:

| Mode family | Shipped |
|---|---|
| **PD** | PD120, PD180, PD240 |
| **Robot** | Robot 24, Robot 36, Robot 72 |
| **Scottie** | Scottie 1, Scottie 2, Scottie DX |
| **Martin** | Martin 1, Martin 2 |

VIS header detection is automatic — feed the decoder audio, get images
out as they complete.

## Why a Rust port?

Several mature C/C++ SSTV decoders exist (slowrx, QSSTV, MMSSTV) but no
production-quality pure-Rust library is available on crates.io. This
crate aims to fill that gap with:

- **Library-first design** — no GUI dependency. The crate processes
  audio buffers and emits image-data events; callers render them however
  they want (Cairo, web canvas, terminal ASCII, file output).
- **Modern Rust idioms** — no `unsafe`, structured error types via
  `thiserror`, builder-style configuration.
- **Comprehensive tests** — round-trip synthetic encoding, regression
  fixtures from real ARISS receptions, cross-validation against slowrx
  on shared test corpora.

## Acknowledgements

This crate would not exist without [slowrx](https://github.com/windytan/slowrx)
by **Oona Räisänen (OH2EIQ)**. slowrx's clear, well-documented C source
served as both the reference implementation and the sanity check during
this port. Algorithm choices, mode-specification tables, frequency-to-pixel
mappings, and overall architecture are all directly inspired by — and in
many places translated from — slowrx.

If you use this crate, please consider also acknowledging the original
project. The SSTV community owes a real debt to Oona's work.
