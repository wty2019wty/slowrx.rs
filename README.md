# slowrx.rs

> **A pure-Rust port of [slowrx](https://github.com/windytan/slowrx)** —
> the SSTV decoder by [Oona Räisänen (OH2EIQ)](https://windytan.github.io/).
> The original is excellent; this port aims to bring it to the Rust
> ecosystem with a library-first API while preserving the algorithmic
> work that made slowrx great.

## Status

🛰️ **0.5.2 — V2.4 published.** PD120, PD180, PD240, Robot 24, Robot 36, Robot 72, Scottie 1, Scottie 2, Scottie DX, Martin 1, and Martin 2 decoding from raw audio. All four V2 mode families landed; the [V2 roadmap](https://github.com/jasonherald/slowrx.rs/issues/9) is closed. Post-V2.4 cleanup (code-review audit backlog, [epic #97](https://github.com/jasonherald/slowrx.rs/issues/97)) is in progress.

PD120, PD180, and Robot 36 are validated end-to-end against real-radio
captures: PD120/PD180 against the ARISS Dec-2017 corpus (6 of 7
fixtures decode to images visually matching the reference JPGs),
Robot 36 against the ARISS Fram2 corpus (all 12 fixtures decode to
images visually matching the reference JPGs — see
`tests/ariss_fram2_validation.md`). PD240, Robot 24, Robot 72,
Scottie 1/2/DX, and Martin 1/2 ship with synthetic round-trip coverage
only — real-radio fixtures for those modes are pending. Robot 24
inherits Robot 36's real-radio evidence by structural identity (same
decoder code path, only LineTime differs). Scottie + Martin share an
RGB-sequential decoder dispatched on `SyncPosition` (Scottie sync
sits mid-line; Martin sync at line start, the standard SSTV
convention).

## Install

```bash
# library
cargo add slowrx

# CLI tool (decodes WAV → PNG)
cargo install slowrx --features cli
```

## Quick start

```rust
use slowrx::{SstvDecoder, SstvEvent};

// Construct a decoder at the caller's audio sample rate.
let mut decoder = SstvDecoder::new(44_100).expect("valid sample rate");

// Feed audio chunks; consume events as images complete.
let audio: Vec<f32> = vec![0.0; 1024]; // mono samples in [-1.0, 1.0]
for event in decoder.process(&audio) {
    if let SstvEvent::ImageComplete { image, .. } = event {
        println!("decoded {}×{} {:?} image",
                 image.width, image.height, image.mode);
    }
}
```

CLI:

```bash
slowrx-cli --input recording.wav --output ./out
# → out/img-001-pd120.png, out/img-002-robot36.png, ...
```

When the VIS header is missing or damaged (or to force a mode you already
know), bypass automatic detection:

```rust
use slowrx::{SstvDecoder, SstvMode};

// Decode every image as PD-120, ignoring VIS.
let mut decoder = SstvDecoder::with_mode(44_100, SstvMode::Pd120)
    .expect("valid sample rate");
```

```bash
slowrx-cli --input recording.wav --output ./out --mode pd120
slowrx-cli --list-modes
```

`--mode` accepts a short name (`pd120`, `robot36`) or display name
(`PD-120`, `Robot 36`), case-insensitively. A forced decoder acquires each
transmission from its periodic sync-pulse train instead of a VIS stop bit, so a
recording holding several transmissions separated by silence yields one
line-0-aligned image each, and sync-less noise or a lone tone does not
fabricate an image. See the `SstvDecoder::with_mode` docs for details.

## What it does

`slowrx.rs` decodes Slow-Scan Television images from a stream of audio
samples. Mode coverage:

| Mode family | Shipped |
|---|---|
| **PD** | PD120, PD180, PD240 |
| **Robot** | Robot 24, Robot 36, Robot 72 |
| **Scottie** | Scottie 1, Scottie 2, Scottie DX |
| **Martin** | Martin 1, Martin 2 |

VIS header detection is automatic — feed the decoder audio, get images
out as they complete.

## Why a Rust port?

Several mature C/C++ SSTV decoders exist (slowrx, QSSTV, MMSSTV) but no
production-quality pure-Rust library is available on crates.io. This
crate aims to fill that gap with:

- **Library-first design** — no GUI dependency. The crate processes
  audio buffers and emits image-data events; callers render them however
  they want (Cairo, web canvas, terminal ASCII, file output).
- **Modern Rust idioms** — no `unsafe`, structured error types via
  `thiserror`, builder-style configuration.
- **Comprehensive tests** — round-trip synthetic encoding, regression
  fixtures from real ARISS receptions, cross-validation against slowrx
  on shared test corpora.

## Acknowledgements

This crate would not exist without [slowrx](https://github.com/windytan/slowrx)
by **Oona Räisänen (OH2EIQ)**. slowrx's clear, well-documented C source
served as both the reference implementation and the sanity check during
this port. Algorithm choices, mode-specification tables, frequency-to-pixel
mappings, and overall architecture are all directly inspired by — and in
many places translated from — slowrx.

If you use this crate, please consider also acknowledging the original
project. The SSTV community owes a real debt to Oona's work.
